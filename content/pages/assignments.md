Paper 1
-------

Compare and contrast Bach's _Prelude in C major_ (WTC I) and Schumann's _Kleine Studie (Album for the Young)_. Both works appear to consist of undifferentiated arpeggiation throughout. How is a sense of melodic structure, phrase, and form achieved in each work? How do they differ?

### Scores

*   Bach, J. S. _Prelude in C major_, BWV 846, from [_Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1_](http://imslp.org/wiki/Well-Tempered_Clavier%2C_Book_1_Nos._1-12%2C_BWV_846-857_%28Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian%29)
*   Schumann, Robert. _Kleine Studie (Little Study)_, No. 14, from [_Album f√ºr die Jugend, Op.68 (Album for the Young)_](http://imslp.org/wiki/Album_f%C3%BCr_die_Jugend%2C_Op.68_%28Schumann%2C_Robert%29).

Paper 2
-------

In his _Mazurka in F minor_ (Op. Posth. 68, No. 4), Chopin writes the following indication: _D.C. dal segno senza fine_. Imagine that you are a pianist and you plan to program this piece. Obviously, Chopin's indication is impractical. Using the tools of musical analysis, make an argument for where or how you should end the mazurka.

### Scores

*   Chopin, Frederic. [_Mazurka in F minor_](http://imslp.org/wiki/Mazurkas_Op.68_%28Chopin%2C_Frederic%29) (Op. Posth. 68, No. 4)

Paper 3 (and Oral Report)
-------------------------

Present an analysis of an eighteenth or nineteenth century tonal composition of your own choice. If you prefer you may choose 2 (or more) shorter works in the same genre (e.g., Lied, character piece, etc.) for comparative analysis. Your topic should be approved before you begin working.

In your presentations, bring recorded excerpts to illustrate your main points (in the case of short works, we can listen to entire movements). Bring xeroxed copies of scores (or excerpts) and analytical diagrams as handouts. Presentations should be 20-30 minutes long.
